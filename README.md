# **Practice React Repository**

Welcome to the Practice React Repository! This repo contains the class material for a react boot-camp I am enrolled in.

**Note:** *This is a practice repository and is not intended for forking or cloning. Instead, please check out some of the finished projects featured on my profile for examples of completed React projects.*

## <u>Contributing</u>

While contributions to this repository are not encouraged, if you notice any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions that fix errors or provide examples of how something can be improved are welcome. Keeping it real...? School me directly with a pull request. It will help me practice and it's a good way to communicate to me and show me something directly and specifically. I love git and github :) 

Please note that this repository is intended for practice only, so major feature additions or changes are not being accepted at this time. First because it would be weird.. second see above :) 

## Support
